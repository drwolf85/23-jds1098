  * `dta/rasters/[COUNTY_FIPS]_mask.tfw` is an adjacent to the GeoTIFF.

* `res/` is the folder containing the results of the data analysis.

  * `res/[NET_ARCH]_results_[COUNTY_FIPS].txt` is the textual file containing the summary statistics produced for the counties with FIPS code `[COUNTY_FIPS]` using the Neural Network model `[NET_ARCH]`, i.e.

    * `dnn` is used for the DNN model in the manuscript.
    * `rnn_ii` is used for the RNN1 model in the manuscript.
    * `rnn_bi` is used for the RNN2 model in the manuscript.

  * `res/overall_means.csv` summarizes the overall accuracy results provided by the `.txt` files with the averages by county and neural network model.
  * `res/time_means.csv` summarizes the elapsed time (in seconds per epoch) provided by the `.txt` files with the averages by county and neural network model.

* `src/` is the folder containing the code to analyze the data.

  * `src/step_0.0_data_download.R` is the R script containing the code to download and prepare the raster datasets.
  * `src/step_0.1_data_prep.R` is the R script containing the code to convert the rasters files to feather datasets. This program needs the output of `src/step_0.0_data_download.R`.
  * `src/step_0.2_compress_data.py` is the python script containing the code to reduce the size of feather files. This program needs the output of `src/step_0.1_data_prep.R`.
  * `src/analysis.c` is the C file containing the code of the two functions used to convert the `uint8` raster data into indicator/dummy and binary variables.
  * `src/Makefile` is the file containing the instructions to compile the C code and create a shared-object (`.so`) library.
  * `src/step_1.0_homc.R` is the R script containing the code to execute the predictive analysis using the HOMC. This program needs the output of `src/step_0.2_compress_data.py`.
  * `src/step_1.1_dnn.py` is the python file containing the code to execute the predictive analysis using the DNN model. This program needs the output of `src/step_0.2_compress_data.py`.
  * `src/step_1.2_rnn_ii.py` is the python file containing the code to execute the predictive analysis using the RNN1. This program needs the output of `src/step_0.2_compress_data.py`.
  * `src/step_1.3_rnn_bi.py` is the python file containing the code to execute the predictive analysis using the RNN2. This program needs the output of `src/step_0.2_compress_data.py`.

  * `src/tfq.py` is the python file containing the code to execute the predictive analysis using the [tensorflow-quantum](https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum) layers in the model architecture. (Do not run if not enough memory is available.) This program needs the output of `src/step_0.2_compress_data.py`.
  * `src/step_2.0_analysis_ggplot2.R` is the R script containing the code to analyze the results and draw the boxplots. This program needs the output of `src/step_1.*.py`.

## Instruction for software usage

Once all the files are extracted as in their folders as described above, navigate to the `src` folder using the bash command:

```{bash}
cd src/
```

download the raster files and prepare the `feather` files using the following set of commands

```{bash}
Rscript step_0.0_data_download.R
Rscript step_0.1_data_prep.R
python3 step_0.2_compress_data.py
```

Compile the C code by entering the following command

```{bash}
make
```

Once the shared object `analysis.so` has been created, execute the analyses by running the python scripts as

```{bash}
for mycode in $(ls step_1.*.py); do python3 $mycode; done
```

For using high order Markov chain through an algorithm that bypasses the estimation of the transition probability matrix, the evaluation of the predictions can be obtained through:

```{bash}
Rscript step_1.0_homc.R
```

Once the predictive analyses are finalized, the distribution of the summary statistics can be obtained with the following command:

```{bash}
Rscript step_2.0_analysis_ggplot2.R
```
